Random Color Palette Picker
===========================

This is a personal project made with HTML5, CSS and JS. It is designed to randomly chose 5 different colors to challenge an artist to create some art with. 

This is my first project where I bring JS into a website style file, so I am proud that everything is working as I intended. With that, I know it's not perfect. Any feedback would be more than welcome.
